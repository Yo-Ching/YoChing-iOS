This about some evil that Player thought he shut down. But it comes back on the sly, from inside the organization.
<p>
That's like treacherous females who play men for their ends. Pick their target, run their game, and own that brother.
Females like that don’t do shit proper. Have no time for romance. Just walk right up to a brother SAYING WHAT UP.
Look out for them type females. 
<p>
Crab ass shit that rises up sly in the organization is like a particular type of female. Some women give up their body easy,
to control a brother's mind. She choose her mark, dress nice, walk up smiling, SAYING WHAT UP.
Brothers should beware females who give the ass up fast. Pussy is some powerful shit.
Make a brother lose his mind a minute. Female like this gets a brother hooked on her ass, then start dealing it like drugs.
Little bit here, little there, until she has power over that brother. Then he’s doing whatever she want, just to hit it.
<p>
<b>WHAT'S UP: Looks harmless, but this diversion will ruin a person or organization, 100%.</b>
