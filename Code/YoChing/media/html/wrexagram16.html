  When people UP FOR IT, shit happens natural.
  Streets are UP FOR IT when a True Player shows up, throws shit down, and moves the crowd.
  To get people UP FOR IT, Player feels what’s good on them streets. He finds out what's hitting.
  Streets move same way them stars do. Seasons come and go, styles rise and fall. Player respects that rhythm.

  Back in the day, ill Big Dogs were bank rolling the first hip hop. When shit first popped off in the park,
  way before them record deals, hard motherfuckers from around the way were paying for studio time.
  Music was for real back then. Had to be. Them hard motherfuckers would represent with that music.
  Be like: “Yo, that's my joint.” Shit had to be tight. Nobody put out a bust ass track for no murderer.

  <b>WHAT'S UP: Lots of excitement. Something is happening. People really feeling it.</b>
