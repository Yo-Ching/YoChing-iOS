  Shit's FALLING APART because ill brothers, crab asses, bad luck and trouble all working on a situation.
  This happens real slow, piece by motherfucking piece. So quiet nobody notice. Situation just FALLING APART,
  like some old house with a roof that's rotting.
  Crab asses are running streets. Pushing their bullshit and getting over.
  <p>
  Real brothers and True Players don't have power now. That ainâ€™t because they fucked up.
  It's just time for crab asses to have their minute. Shit runs in cycles.
  <p>
  <b>WHAT'S UP: Solid situation if falling to pieces here. Not much to do but get out of it. Bad times.</b>
