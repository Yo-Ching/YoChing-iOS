If a brother leaves food out on the counter for a few days, that SHIT BEEN SPOILT.
SHIT BEEN SPOILT because brothers dropped the ball. Itâ€™s different from Stagnatin'.
<p>
When SHIT BEEN SPOILT the problem don't have nothing to do with outside circumstance.
It ain't happen from crab asses rising, ill brothers rolling, or streets going dark.
SHIT BEEN SPOILT because some brothers let their situation slide.
That's all. If brothers put in some work, shit will turn around.
When True Player pulls into some SHIT BEEN SPOILT, he stays clean.
Like a train pulling up to the platform, True Player moves brothers.
Rolls them someplace better.
<p>
<b>WHAT'S UP: This situation is fucked up. People really dropped the ball. Turn it around.</b>
