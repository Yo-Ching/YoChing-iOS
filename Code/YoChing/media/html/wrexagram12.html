  Peace is nice and chill, with love on them streets. When shit is STAGNATIN', nothing positive happening at all.
  Shit is fucked now. There's lots of confusion in the organization. Ill brothers are driving.
  Them motherfuckers just don't give a fuck. True Players realize it ain't the moment to positively affect shit.
  When crab asses and ill brothers run the game, nobody trust nobody. Nothing positive can happen.
  True Player pulls back. He donâ€™t throw in with ill brothers. Even if they running crews paid crazy.

    WHAT'S UP: Bad situation. Lots of confusion and negativity. Don't get yourself involved.
